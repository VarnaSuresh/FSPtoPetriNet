<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The analysis functions operate on 
  the target composite process indicated in the <b>Target</b> choice box. If this 
  has not been compiled or composed, compilation and composition are automatically 
  invoked. </font></p>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Safety</B><BR>
  Performs a breadth first search on the target LTS. If a property violation or 
  deadlock is found, the shortest trace of actions that would lead to the property 
  violation or deadlock is displayed in the output window. </font></p>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Progress</B><BR>
  Computes the connected components for the target LTS. Checks for progress violations 
  with respect to the declared progress properties. If no progress properties 
  are declared then a check with respect to a default property is performed. The 
  default property has all the actions in the alphabet of the current target. 
  </font></p>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>LTL Property</B><BR>
  Compiles the selected LTL property into a Buchi automata using Giannakopoulou's 
  LTL2Buchi translator and performs a model check to see if the selected target 
  system is a model of the property. The model checking algorithm for liveness 
  properties is a depth first search for commected components as for progress 
  properties. If an LTL property can be determined to be a safety property, then 
  a breadth first search as in safety above is performed. Partial Order Reduction 
  can be used in both searches to reduce the number of states that have to be 
  explored to check a property.</font></p>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Run</B><BR>
  Performs a user-controlled animation of the target composite process. Uses the 
  component LTSs rather than the composite LTS, so larger systems can be animated 
  even if they cannot be exhaustively checked. The DEFAULT entry in the Run list 
  is the alphabet of the target composite process and allows explicit contol of 
  all actions. This may be reduced by declaring an explicit <strong>menu</strong> 
  e.g. </font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">menu RUN = {toss}</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2"></font></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
<p>The current state of each component LTS displayed in the Draw panel is updated 
  by the animator. The Animator window includes <strong>Run</strong> and <strong>Step</strong> 
  buttons. These are used to control actions which are not in the action menu 
  and consequently do not have click boxes. These buttons are not enabled if the 
  autorun option is selected in the <a href="optionsmenu.html"><strong>Options</strong></a> 
  menu. The <strong>Run</strong> button permits a sequence of actions to occur 
  where these actions are not explicitly controlled. The <strong>Step</strong> 
  button permits a single such action to occur.</p>
</font>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Supertrace</B><BR>
  Depth first reachability analysis using Holtzmann's bitstate hashing technique 
  (Supertrace). Note that Supertrace is not a complete search of the state space. 
  Supertrace should be used only where a complete search of the state space is 
  not possible due to size. </font></p>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Stop</B><BR>
  This item is enabled whenever the LTSA is performing a lengthy computation. 
  If invoked, <strong>Stop</strong> aborts the computation. It is usually invoked 
  from the tool bar. </font></P>
