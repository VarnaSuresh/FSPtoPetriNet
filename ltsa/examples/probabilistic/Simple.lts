/*
Here, we have a simple interaction between two processes, without action sharing.
We can see that the scheduler gives equal priority to each process.
Since there are no shared actions, both processes can act on all their actions,
and they do so with the specified probabilities.
>From state 0, we have two transitions, one for each process. As we see, the
probabilities of the transition elements are exactly as specified, only divided
by two. This shows us that the scheduler gives each process an equal share.
