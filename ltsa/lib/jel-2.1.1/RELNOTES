                   NEW FEATURES in version 2.1.1.

1. Better error messages for numerical literal overflow.
   Unlike the previous versions, which simply claimed that an unexpected
   character is encountered when numerical literals were too large to fit
   in various data types, this version returns a fully customizable error
   messages in a number of such cases.

2. Automatic boxing of the primitive types (and JEL reflection types).
   JEL now automatically wraps the primitive types into the corresponding
   Java reflection objects. Thus, it is now possible to call the function
   func(Integer i) via the expression "func(1)". Note that in this case
   two conversions are actually performed: 1) from byte to int (which is
   evaluated at compile time); 2) from int to java.lang.Integer (which
   takes place at run time).
   Still, it is advisable to use the primitive types in your expressions
   as much as possible for the best performance.

3. Minor spelling fixes.
